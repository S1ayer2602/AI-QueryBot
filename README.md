# AI-QueryBot

**AI-QueryBot** is a Question-Answering chatbot that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs). This project enables users to ask questions and receive answers generated by an LLM while retrieving relevant documents to enhance the response accuracy. It is inspired by the RAG Q-A chatbot project from Kaggle and has been extended with additional functionality, including a Gradio UI for an interactive chat experience.

## Overview

The goal of **AI-QueryBot** is to answer user queries by combining the strengths of pre-trained language models and a retrieval mechanism. The model first retrieves relevant documents and then generates a response by conditioning on both the query and the retrieved documents. This enables more accurate and context-aware responses.

## Features

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Combines retrieval and generation models for better question-answering.
- **LLM Integration:** Leverages large language models for natural language understanding and response generation.
- **Document Retrieval:** Retrieves relevant information from a corpus of documents to assist in answering questions.
- **Interactive UI:** Includes a Gradio-based chat UI for easy interaction with the bot.
- **Customizable Corpus:** Users can upload their own documents to create a domain-specific Q&A bot.

## Technologies

This project uses the following key technologies and frameworks:

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Transformers (Hugging Face)**: For working with pre-trained LLMs.
- **Gradio**: For building the web-based user interface.
- **LangChain**: For chaining LLMs and managing complex workflows.
- **FAISS**: For efficient document retrieval.
- **Pandas**: For data processing.
- **PyTorch**: As the backend for training and fine-tuning models.
